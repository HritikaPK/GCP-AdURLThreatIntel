# AdThreatIntel â€“ Cloud-Based Malvertising Detection System

AdThreatIntel is a serverless threat-intelligence system that analyzes advertising URLs for suspicious patterns, stores results in BigQuery, and visualizes detections via a Streamlit dashboard on Cloud Run using Cloud Run Function.

This project demonstrates practical skills in cloud security engineering, threat intelligence automation, and serverless architecture on Google Cloud.

## Overview

Malicious advertising (malvertising) frequently includes encoded URLs, redirect chains, and suspicious domains to disseminate harmful content.  
This is a simulation of a lightweight threat-detection pipeline designed to identify suspicious ad URLs.It is something I can build on top of over time.

**Pipeline flow:**

1. User triggers a scan in the dashboard

2. Cloud Function loads and analyzes URLs

3. Results written to BigQuery

4. Summary report stored in Cloud Storage

5. Dashboard fetches and displays detections

## Detection Logic

Indicators analyzed include:

| Indicator | Example | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
Suspicious TLDs | `.xyz`, `.top`, `.click` | Common in malicious infra |
Encoded characters | `%2F`, `%3D`, hex sequences | Obfuscation techniques |
Redirect params | `redirect=`, `url=` | Redirect-based exploitation |
Long/complex URLs | 100+ chars | Cloaking/affiliate hops |
Keyword patterns | `login`, `verify`, `secure` | Phishing behaviors |

Output includes URL, score, reasons, and timestamp.
